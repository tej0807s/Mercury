            Mercury
        </h2>
        <p>
            Mercury is the smallest planet in the Solar System and the closest to the Sun. Its orbit around the Sun
            takes 87.97 Earth days, the shortest of all the Sun's planets. It is named after the Roman god Mercurius
            (Mercury), god of commerce, messenger of the gods, and mediator between gods and mortals, corresponding to
            the Greek god Hermes. Like Venus, Mercury orbits the Sun within Earth's orbit as an inferior planet, and its
            apparent distance from the Sun as viewed from Earth never exceeds 28°. This proximity to the Sun means the
            planet can only be seen near the western horizon after sunset or the eastern horizon before sunrise, usually
            in twilight. At this time, it may appear as a bright star-like object but is often far more difficult to
            observe than Venus. From Earth, the planet telescopically displays the complete range of phases, similar to
            Venus and the Moon, which recurs over its synodic period of approximately 116 days.

            Internal structure
        </h2>
        <p>
            Mercury appears to have a solid silicate crust and mantle overlying a solid, iron sulfide outer core layer,
            a deeper liquid core layer, and a solid inner core. The planet's density is the second highest in the Solar
            System at 5.427 g/cm3, only slightly less than Earth's density of 5.515 g/cm3. If the effect of
            gravitational compression were to be factored out from both planets, the materials of which Mercury is made
            would be denser than those of Earth, with an uncompressed density of 5.3 g/cm3 versus Earth's 4.4 g/cm3.
            Mercury's density can be used to infer details of its inner structure. Although Earth's high density results
            appreciably from gravitational compression, particularly at the core, Mercury is much smaller and its inner
            regions are not as compressed. Therefore, for it to have such a high density, its core must be large and
            rich in iron.

            Surface geology
        </h2>
        <p>
            Mercury's surface is similar in appearance to that of the Moon, showing extensive mare-like plains and heavy
            cratering, indicating that it has been geologically inactive for billions of years. It is more heterogeneous
            than either Mars's or the Moon's, both of which contain significant stretches of similar geology, such as
            maria and plateaus. Albedo features are areas of markedly different reflectivity, which include impact
            craters, the resulting ejecta, and ray systems. Larger albedo features correspond to higher reflectivity
            plains. Mercury has dorsa (also called "wrinkle-ridges"), Moon-like highlands, montes (mountains), planitiae
            (plains), rupes (escarpments), and valles (valleys).

            GSLV MkIII, chosen to launch Chandrayaan-2 spacecraft, is a three-stage heavy lift launch vehicle developed
            by ISRO. The vehicle has two solid strap-ons, a core liquid booster and a cryogenic upper stage.GSLV Mk III
            is designed to carry 4 ton class of satellites into Geosynchronous Transfer Orbit (GTO) or about 10 tons to
            Low Earth Orbit (LEO), which is about twice the capability of the GSLV Mk II.The two strap-on motors of GSLV
            Mk III are located on either side of its core liquid booster. Designated as ‘S200’, each carries 205 tons of
            composite solid propellant and their ignition results in vehicle lift-off. S200s function for 140 seconds.
            During strap-ons functioning phase, the two clustered Vikas liquid Engines of L110 liquid core booster will
            ignite 114 sec after lift -off to further augment the thrust of the vehicle. These two engines continue to
            function after the separation of the strap-ons at about 140 seconds after lift -off.
